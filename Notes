
* EditEvent
	* Buttons & pickers for Date and time (including finish time!!)
	* Email addresses for contacts - need to be able to get them from Contacts app
	* Venue/Location - user types in Venue (String), this is passed to Google Maps (use class Geocoder) and lat/long is returned and stored
	* Done/Cancel in action bar
	* ***********************
	* Have to re-do everything related to calendar to work with startTime and endTime instead of calendar
	* only allow one date for the wo times, no events that go over two (or more) different days

* Agenda View
	* Set up adapter
	* Sort by date
	* Pressing or long-pressing gives a small pop-up for Edit/Delete options
		* if not feasible, just go straight to edit
		
	* Should events that have finished be displayed??
	
* Week/Month View
	* Week view - week agenda like DigiCal Week Agenda. Horizontal swipe for different weeks
	* Month View - Calendar Month takes up 70% of screen, with indicators on days with events.
	 			   Clicking on a date reveals events for that day in the bottom 30% of screen
	* Same press/long press behavior as the Agenda View
		* If the edit/Delete thing isn't feasible, then just go straight to edit. 
	
* Other
	* Action Bar spinner for changing between Agenda/Month view
	* May need to make an abstract EventAdapter, then subclass.  Necessary adapters:
		* AgendaView - list 
		* Month View - gridView and ListView below
	* Making the adapters observers that observe the DataEngine would be ideal so that the automatically update.
	* Address is an Android package and not serializable, so had to remove to pass things to EventEditor
	
* Do Different views first with basic Event data, then do EditEvent Activity and associated functionality.
